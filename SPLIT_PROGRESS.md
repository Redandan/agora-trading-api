# Split Progress

## Current Baseline

- `agora-trading-api` is extracted and compiles as a standalone Spring Boot app.
- Current test baseline: `mvn test` should load the full Spring context with `com.agora` component scanning.
- The repo keeps trading/system runtime code needed for the Spring context. Marketplace auth/frontend remnants are treated as forbidden cleanup regressions by `scripts/verify_local.ps1`.

## Completed

- Trading app entry point uses full `com.agora` component scan.
- JPA repository scan is limited to trading/system repositories.
- Obvious marketplace product/order/cart/delivery/game/webpush/notification code was removed from trading.
- `AgoraMarketExchangeRateServiceImpl` uses the `agora-market-internal-client` SDK when configured.
- `StaticExchangeRateServiceImpl` exists as the local/downstream-failure fallback.
- Flutter/AppVersion deployment leftovers were removed from trading.
- UserSearchLog/SearchLogAspect leftovers were removed from trading.
- CustomerIssue/support-ticket leftovers were removed from trading.
- Product classification and image audit leftovers were removed from trading.
- UserAddress, postal-area, and delivery-country leftovers were removed from trading.
- Unused OAuth2 service interfaces and OAuth2 DTO leftovers were removed from trading.
- WalletConnect/Web3 login leftovers and the unused OAuth2 client dependency were removed from trading.
- Unused AuthService/AuthCode/2FA and marketplace account-login DTO leftovers were removed from trading.
- WebPush, product-report, product-validator, cart-summary, and marketplace order-event leftovers were removed from trading.
- Unused marketplace delivery/order/wallet enums, notification enums, logistics utilities, and delivery/digital-order properties were removed from trading.
- Empty legacy marketplace MCP tool placeholders were removed from trading.
- Unreferenced betting and marketplace status/type enums were removed from trading.
- Unused PWA log, traffic analytics, slot analytics DTOs, slot symbol enum, slot cache, and stale product/PWA/slot security rules were removed from trading.
- Unreferenced chat, staking, transaction DTOs and unused marketplace/betting enums were removed from trading.
- Unused referrer DTO and marketplace logistics enum translation leftovers were removed from trading.
- Unused Telegram login/OAuth binding service chain was removed from trading while keeping Telegram notifications and MCP auth intact.
- Unused member CRUD service and member admin DTO leftovers were removed from trading.
- Unused marketplace user fields, user repository member queries, and post service/DTO leftovers were removed from trading.
- Unused web JWT filter, CurrentUser resolver, UserDetailsService, and `/auth/**` route leftover were removed while keeping MCP API-key auth intact.
- Trading withdrawal risk state no longer reads the marketplace `users` table; unused User entity/repository, AutoReply service, and WebRTC signaling service leftovers were removed.
- Trading no longer accepts login/member JWTs; MCP protected tools use service-level API-key authorization only.
- `AgoraMarketAPI` now has the first internal exchange-rate endpoint:
  - `GET /api/internal/exchange-rates/usdt`
  - `GET /api/internal/exchange-rates/usdt/{currency}`
  - Header: `X-Internal-Api-Key`
  - Provider property: `internal.api-key=${INTERNAL_API_KEY:}`
- `AgoraMarketAPI/internal-client` now contains an independently buildable thin SDK:
  - `ExchangeRateInternalClient`
  - `HttpExchangeRateInternalClient`
  - `ExchangeRateInfo`
  - `AgoraMarketInternalClientProperties`

## Exchange Rate Runtime

Keep static fallback behavior for:

- Local dev without `AGORA_MARKET_INTERNAL_API_KEY`.
- AgoraMarketAPI downtime.
- Timeout or `401` during transition.

Fresh-machine build prerequisite:

```powershell
mvn -f C:\Users\Redan\IdeaProjects\AgoraMarketAPI\internal-client\pom.xml install
```

## Acceptance And Deploy

AgoraMarketAPI deployment/acceptance runbook:

- `C:\Users\Redan\IdeaProjects\AgoraMarketAPI\docs\split-service-acceptance-deploy.md`

Trading deployment prep:

- Trading has a deploy skeleton in `deploy.sh`.
- `scripts/bootstrap_server.sh` can clone/fetch the repo on the server and write a non-secret env template.
- 2026-06-05 server preflight confirmed AgoraMarketAPI is healthy on local port `8082`.
- 2026-06-05 server bootstrap installed `/home/ubuntu/agora-trading-api` and verified fast-forward from `origin/main`.
- 2026-06-05 server bootstrap created `/home/ubuntu/agora-trading-api/.env.trading.secrets.example`.
- 2026-06-05 server configuration created `/home/ubuntu/.env.trading.secrets` without printing secret values.
- 2026-06-05 server configuration created independent MySQL database `agora_trading` for trading runtime.
- 2026-06-05 server configuration installed nginx `/api/trading/` routing.
- 2026-06-05 server deployment completed from `origin/main` commit `11612b9`.
- 2026-06-05 trading service started on active port `8084`.
- 2026-06-05 `scripts/verify_server.sh` passed with public health check:
  - `https://agoramarketapi.purrtechllc.com/api/trading/actuator/health`
- Production defines `AGORA_MARKET_INTERNAL_API_KEY` in `/home/ubuntu/.env.trading.secrets`, so trading can call AgoraMarket exchange rates and still fall back on timeout or failure.
- Current `origin/main` has advanced beyond the observed deployed commit. Treat production currentness as unproven until `deploy.sh` and `scripts/verify_server.sh` are re-run on the server.

## Cleanup Priority

1. Replace Hibernate `ddl-auto=update` production bootstrap with explicit trading migrations before treating the deploy as full production hardening.
2. Re-run server deploy/verify when production deployment is explicitly requested.

## Do Not Do Yet

- Do not share marketplace JPA entities with trading.
- Do not let trading read the marketplace database directly.
- Do not add identity internal API until shared login is required.
- Do not convert every leftover marketplace service into an internal API.
