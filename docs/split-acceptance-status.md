# Split Acceptance Status

Last verified: 2026-07-24

This file is the concise current handoff for the standalone Trading service.
Historical acceptance detail remains in Git and `SPLIT_PROGRESS.md`; it is not
runnable current guidance.

## Current production identity

- repository/server directory: `/home/ubuntu/agora-trading-api`;
- worktree, `origin/main`, and deployed app commit: `788ad4a8c60c`;
- active port: `8085`;
- inactive blue/green port: `8084`, drained;
- local and public dedicated health: passed;
- local and public dedicated MCP: passed with Bearer authentication;
- shared-host `/api/trading/mcp`: blocked with HTTP 404;
- AgoraMarket internal dependency health: passed;
- nginx shared/dedicated upstreams: active port `8085`;
- server worktree: clean.

The current server verification command is:

```powershell
.\scripts\verify_server_ssh.ps1
```

Use `-SchemaCompare` only when entity/schema ownership changed. Verification is
read-only and does not authorize deployment or trading actions.

## Current runtime boundary

Trading owns:

- versioned strategy catalog;
- owner 508 PAPER accounting;
- Donchian SHADOW evidence;
- exact strategy-owned market streams;
- spot OCO reconciliation and account/order safety;
- read-only provider-managed OKX Native Spot Grid monitoring;
- minimal Trading MCP and internal read-only reports;
- Trading schema validation and deployment.

AgoraMarketAPI continues to own:

- marketplace behavior and marketplace user identity;
- Telegram webhook and command dispatch;
- the internal exchange-rate API consumed by Trading.

The shared `agora_market` database remains expected. Extra marketplace tables
are not a Trading cleanup target.

## Strategy state

The runtime catalog contains exactly two executable/evidence contracts:

| Contract | Mode | Market data | Exchange order |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TV_BTC_DAILY_ACCUMULATION_V1@v1` | PAPER | Binance `BTCUSDT@1d` | not allowed |
| `BTC_DONCHIAN_20D_10D_V1@v1` | SHADOW | OKX `BTCUSDT@1h` | not allowed |

Owner 508 is a display alias for
`TV_BTC_DAILY_ACCUMULATION_V1@v1`. Its temporary database mapping is strategy
`485`. Database strategy `508` is a different archived strategy.

Current owner 508 settings:

```text
configuredEnabled=false
configuredExecutionMode=BTC_BASE_PAPER
configuredStrategyId=485
exchangeOrderAuthorized=false
```

The Binance daily stream remains connected for catalog readiness, but the 508
evaluator does not run while `configuredEnabled=false`.

Donchian runtime evidence is enabled in SHADOW. It has no live implementation,
order, OCO, or Telegram path and cannot block owner 508.

Every unlisted database strategy is `ARCHIVED`; a database `enabled` value
cannot start a stream or enter the runtime evaluation path.

## Market data

Production startup confirmed exactly:

```text
binance SPOT BTCUSDT@1d
okx     SPOT BTCUSDT@1h
```

The catalog owns this inventory. Database strategy flags, environment item
lists, warm-up evaluation, database-change resubscription, and dual-provider
divergence logic do not control subscriptions.

The hourly orchestrator is limited to K-line gap detection/repair. It does not
run AI, ML, meta-control, or position-advice tasks.

## OKX Native Spot Grid

One provider-managed BTC-USDT Spot Grid is running:

```text
algoId=3767345250394603520
algoClOrdId=AGOKXG120260723032002
range=63978..67259
gridNum=10
quoteInvestment=10 USDT
state=running
```

Trading can read active/history/detail, sub-orders, fills, provider grouping,
fees, and economic evidence. It cannot create, amend, or stop a native Grid.
Grid state and floating PnL can change independently of a service deployment.

## Execution safety

The current read-only execution-safety result is:

```text
id=260 BTCUSDT LONG INTENTIONAL_BTC_BASE_NO_OCO
id=261 BTCUSDT LONG INTENTIONAL_BTC_BASE_NO_OCO
id=262 BTCUSDT LONG INTENTIONAL_BTC_BASE_NO_OCO
protected=0
intentionalNoOco=3
issues=0
status=OK
```

The OKX private `orders-algo` WebSocket and OCO polling/reconciliation remain
enabled. These are mechanical execution-safety components, not strategy
quality gates. They may reconcile fills/position state or place a protective
OCO for an eligible legacy position. Intentional BTC Base holdings suppress
generic OCO retry.

## MCP surface

Production exposes exactly 10 tools:

1. `getMcpRegistryVersion`
2. `getStrategyRuntimeCatalog`
3. `getOwner508RuntimeStatus`
4. `analyzeBtcDonchianShadowGoldenParity`
5. `getBtcDonchianShadowReadiness`
6. `getOkxNativeSpotGridStatus`
7. `getOkxNativeSpotGridAcceptanceEvidence`
8. `getExecutionSafetyStatus`
9. `getOpenSpotPositions`
10. `getExchangeAccountSafetySnapshot`

The registry has 11 resources: one version resource and one resource per tool.
Missing, invalid, unknown, and unannotated tool calls fail closed. There is no
Guardian key, External-AI session, Trading-local approval state, or Telegram
approval path.

## Internal reports and notifications

AgoraMarketAPI may call these read-only Trading report routes with the internal
API key:

- `/api/trading/internal/reports/current`;
- `/api/trading/internal/reports/analysis`;
- `/api/trading/internal/reports/weekly`;
- `/api/trading/internal/reports/market-signal-risk/drilldown`.

Trading retains outbound Telegram alerts needed by market-data and
execution-safety components. It does not own the Telegram webhook or callback
state.

## Local acceptance boundary

The repository test tree and non-deployment verification scripts were removed
during strategy-first simplification. For a code-removal batch, local
acceptance is:

```powershell
mvn -DskipTests package
git diff --check
```

Direct source/config assertions must additionally prove:

- exactly 10 MCP tools;
- exactly two catalog contracts and no `LIVE` mode;
- owner 508 and Donchian mappings unchanged;
- no Grid mutation adapter;
- database flags cannot start streams;
- no database migration or table deletion;
- retained deployment scripts still parse.

For docs-only changes, `git diff --check` is sufficient unless the document
claims new runtime or deployment evidence.

## Cleanup handoff

The current staged source-reduction plan is
`docs/minimal-runtime-cleanup-roadmap.md`.

Batch 1 is locally implemented and verified but is not committed or deployed.
It removes the unreachable Execution Event, SystemReminder, isolated
Meta/Attention, and auto-exploration rollout source while leaving historical
database tables unchanged. The local candidate compiles and retains the 10-tool
and protected-runtime source invariants.

The protected keep set is:

- 508 PAPER engine and its minimum captured-strategy dependency closure;
- Donchian SHADOW evidence;
- the two catalog market streams and gap repair;
- OKX account/order reads, private WebSocket, OCO reconciliation, and BTC
  ownership;
- read-only provider Grid monitoring;
- 10-tool MCP, internal reports, critical outbound notifications, health,
  schema validation, and deployment.

Recommended next action: review and commit Batch 1, then obtain separate
deployment authorization and run Production acceptance. Do not begin the
alternative-data batch until Batch 1 is accepted.

## Not proven by acceptance

Deployment and health evidence do not prove:

- owner 508 profitability;
- Donchian forward profitability;
- Grid long-term profitability;
- authorization to enable PAPER or LIVE;
- authorization to place/cancel/modify an order or OCO;
- authorization to create/stop a Grid;
- authorization to move funds, send an operator message, or alter Production;
- authorization to migrate or delete database tables.
